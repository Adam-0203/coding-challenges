# Nonlinear Equations

## Description
This folder contains implementations of **numerical methods for solving nonlinear equations** of the form:

f(x) = 0

Each method approximates a root using a different strategy, allowing comparison in terms of **convergence speed, robustness, and requirements**.

## Implemented Methods
The following algorithms are included:

- **Dichotomy (Bisection)**  
  Robust method based on interval subdivision.

- **Newton’s Method**  
  Fast method using first-order derivatives.

- **Newton Method with Second-Order Taylor Approximation**  
  Extension of Newton’s method using curvature information.

- **Secant Method**  
  Derivative-free method approximating the slope numerically.

- **Method Comparison**  
  Visual comparison of convergence behavior between classical methods.
