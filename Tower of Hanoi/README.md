# Tower of Hanoi

A simple implementation of the **Tower of Hanoi** problem in Python.

## Description
The program solves the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle for `n` disks, moving all disks from the source rod to the target rod following these rules:  
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.  
2. A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk or an empty rod.  
3. All disks start on the source rod and must end on the target rod.

## Usage
- Run the program and input the number of disks.  
- The program outputs each move step-by-step.
