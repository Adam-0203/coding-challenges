# LU Decomposition

## Description
This folder contains implementations of **LU factorization** for square matrices.

Two approaches are included:
- **Without pivoting**: basic Gaussian elimination to produce L and U.  
- **With partial pivoting**: adds a permutation matrix P for numerical stability.

---

## Objectives
- Factor a matrix A into L · U (or P · A = L · U)  
- Understand the role of pivoting in stability  
- Compare implementations with and without pivoting  

---

## Applications
LU decomposition is widely used for:
- Solving systems of linear equations efficiently  
- Inverting matrices  
- Computing determinants  
- Numerical simulations and scientific computing
