# Fractal Drawer with Pygame

This Python project draws a simple fractal using **Pygame**. The fractal is generated by iterating a complex function over each pixel and coloring it based on the result.

## How it Works

- The window size is `500x500` pixels.
- Each pixel `(x, y)` is mapped to a complex number `c`.
- The iterative formula is:  
  ```python
  z = z*z + c
